## Testing
**31 Jan:** Created the structure of the website. No relevant issues found during this process, I couldn't remember many things, but after a review of the first Milestone, w3school, Code Institute's online lessons, everything became very natural to use, and I felt much more confident than in the first Milestone. Created a simple header, a nav bar, a simple footer.

**01 Feb:** CSS issue. Nav bar showed 40px padding left that prevented the menu to be exacly in the center. Added padding: 0; to nav ul, in the CSS file, added justify-content: space-evenly; and removed margin: auto; the menu is exactly where I wanted now.

**04 Feb:** Fixed responsive design for both the header and the footer. The headers looks to be too big when the screen goes over the 576px. I will need to reduce the header size, but I need to create the game first, so that I can choose the correct size for the header, and have a good balance between the header and the body. I also fixed the burger menu, looks nicer now and more balanced with the screen size.

**04 Feb:** I created a structure for the memory games with 24 picture. I could see that actually 24 picture are too many, and take too much space in the webpage not offering a really nice UX, and would be hard to follow. After many test, I reduced to 20, but still the same result. I'm now happy with 16 pictures.

## Testing
**31 Jan:** Created the structure of the website. No relevant issues found during this process, I couldn't remember many things, but after a review of the first Milestone, w3school, Code Institute's online lessons, everything became very natural to use, and I felt much more confident than in the first Milestone. Created a simple header, a nav bar, a simple footer.
